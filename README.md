# Interoperable Wisdom Commons - Mapathon 21

_This website is a derivation of a Miro board created during Mapathon 21 on 2021-10-16: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lqaPCGw=/>. Please send questions or comments or changes to this website to [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com)._

**Overview**

There are many solutions databases, archives, knowledge banks, wikis, etc. that exist within our shared ecosystem, but many of these efforts exist in silos. As we gather, map, and grow the resources that are emerging from our shared collective intelligence, how do we steward these resources together and coordinate our efforts to grow and share these wisdom commons?

[[Gathering Wisdom and Knowledge]] - _For each resource, fill out the 3 hexagons indicating: Who, Why, What, How_

[[Context and Definitions]] - _What do we mean by Knowledge? By Wisdom? What do we mean by Wisdom Commons? Dynamic Knowledge Repository?_

[[Roundtable Discussion]] - _How might we create compatible, coordinated, and/or interoperable solutions databases, wisdom repositories, knowledge libraries and shared archives that aggregates our collective intelligence, allows for accessibility----- while also ensuring that information and wisdom remains culturally, ecologically & contextually relevant, that the sources remain honored, and allows for emergence, nuance, diversity?_

[[Topical Discussion 1]] - _What is required to build Networks of Trust that foster sharing and nurture Wisdom Commons? What some considerations? Some constraints? Some protocols?_

[[Topical Discussion 2]] - _Logistics and technical considerations: What are some initial "hows" to creating interoperability/ compatibility /sharing of repositories, archives, databases, etc._

[[Harvest and Next Steps]] - _What is possible, interesting, inspiring? Plus invitations to continue conversation_

**Additional Context**

[Open Future Coalition](https://www.openfuturecoalition.org/) is building a dynamic knowledge repository within our platform. We want to ensure that as we design our own dynamic knowledge/wisdom repositories (templates, toolkits, blogs, posts, documents, media artifacts, stories, etc.) that we ensure compatibly with others in our shared ecosystem who are undertaking similar efforts.

[CiCoLab](https://www.collectiveintelligencecollaboratory.com/) is also building a knowledge repository- see example of resources:

- [[CICOLAB Knowledge Repository]]
- [[Repository Asset Types]]

Additional side note, we are hosting working group discussions that include the topics of interoperability and wisdom commons every three weeks and would like to welcome additional participants to continue this conversation!
