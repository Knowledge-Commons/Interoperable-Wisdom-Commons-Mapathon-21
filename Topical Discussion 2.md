# Topical Discussion 2

_Logistics and technical considerations: What are some initial "hows" to creating interoperability/ compatibility /sharing of repositories, archives, databases, etc._

Considerations for Interoperable Data structures

Opportunities for adopting Shared language, taxonomies, ontologies, commons semantics, shared badges, etc. (IRIS, SDG's and Beyond, etc.)

All choose a shared DID implementation we use/support across our platforms?

Adopt + add to schema.org schemas for different data types?

Human-centric- human in the middle AI

Thinking about repositories as clusters of nodes rather than as objects might be a useful perspective shift.

The Formal Bridge- Sharing data

Map Templates for repositories

Graph databases

Protocols, not platforms

Starburst interlocking Star Gate Portals with gradient metrics and levels of impact

Yes! I see a movement for the Water that empowers a decentralized movement to heal our watersheds.

Unique hex IDs could be correlative to the decentralized identifier framework that Collaborative Tech Alliance has implemented

it it is less critical to come up with a super upper ontology. More critical to understand how we engage in merger processes.

We need a list of all Miro boards for public collaboration and a set time to meet each week or month...

It can be as simple as short MoUs between each other’s platforms/projects to start :) would love to share the written agreements that maybe some of already have with each other and build on those ?

'++ the importance of the compatibility and emergence of the multimodal / many to many - necessary complexity that pulses to common visibility at the right levels and contexts for integration'

Light touch- diversity-non-linear

Right relations ( with each other, with tech, with life, etc. et.c)

Private Membership Associations for Wisdom Graphs?!?!

Storytelling- bringing stories into digital spaces and keeping them in place
