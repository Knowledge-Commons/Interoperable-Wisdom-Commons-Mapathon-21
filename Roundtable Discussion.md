# Roundtable Discussion

_How might we create compatible, coordinated, and/or interoperable solutions databases, wisdom repositories, knowledge libraries and shared archives that aggregates our collective intelligence, allows for accessibility----- while also ensuring that information and wisdom remains culturally, ecologically & contextually relevant, that the sources remain honored, and allows for emergence, nuance, diversity?_

we could take some lessons from "text as a symposium", [Talmud as Hypertext](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/3.1/coverweb/porush/contra4.html)

Vincent: How do we better align the efforts and incentives of: knowledge workers, platform builders, and the various stakeholders? There are so many different roles involved in this collective effort such as curators, caretakers, collectors, connectors, facilitators, builders...

Living Systems Principles

the return of storytelling (wisdom in context). oral record has preserved the majority of wisdom prior to printing press and allowed for survival of communities. there is value here!

Wisdom as reintegration to living ecosystem (complex adaptive relationships)

Holochain as built on consent as a fundamental principle

Meta Patterns

social standards, tech standards allowing for implementation and governance diversity while still meeting a spec for federation

interoperable data fields / currency of data / Warm Data

narrative context conversation deliberation trust between people accessible (both read and write) to people who have different literacies (not just text+computers+data literacy)

Transparent, trustable visibility into the provenance of the information, knowledge and wisdom

versioning and attribution, governance / tokenization, federation protocol (social/conceptual/technical)

Wisdom commons as redistributive mechanism for traditional ecological wisdom keepers!!

Wiser Earth- once a hub- defunct database- learning from previous iterations

[JLINC](https://www.jlinc.com/) - data provenance

Connected theme: generative commons license

moving away from problems to opportunities, scarcity to abundance, solvability to emergence, speed to flow, scale to fractals

Inviting and listening to all impacted groups in the design. Designing databases to request and respect consent of those communities (opt-in)

[Murmurations Protocol](https://murmurations.network/)

Standards and protocols (ISO, etc.)

Vetting of information

Some folks have been chatting about how IP law might need to evolve in order to support a Wisdom Commons

respectful sourcing and accountability (anonymity is tricky; very useful and constructive in certain contexts, dangerous in others)

Respect Consent- ask permission- opt in- communities to have control over what they share

Contribution and Attribution- Who is contributing? What is identity? TRUST- how do we track and make visible trust??

To preserve diversity and flexibility, need to choose the right "container" for knowledge/wisdom - graph databases > relational databases, allowing for branching and version control seem helpful too

[[Repository Asset Types]]

messy, human-friendly replication (not necessarily perfect duplication) and adaptation to individuals and communities -- think gossip, lore, legends, parables, heros, vililans, gods, people

how does knowledge and wisdom _evolve_ over time, while retaining a history of what it used to be and how it changed?
