# Context and Definitions

_What do we mean by Knowledge? By Wisdom? What do we mean by Wisdom Commons? Dynamic Knowledge Repository?_

CHARLES: Fundamental to these repository efforts in any org., group or initiative is values-based community collaboration between members and various participants, collectively activating, pollinating and cultivating wisdom gardens through a range of interactions from communicating to choreographing within complex systems integrating myriad elements, dimensions and factors. Wisdom is contrasted with knowledge and intelligence in that broad benefit to the whole community or system — the biggest picture context — is considered, assessed and emphasized over the long term (e.g., seven generations or more).

An adjacent concept I've found helpful is praxis, which I understand as knowledge / wisdom as expressed in practice. Having a high degree of shared praxis seems to be an important condition of collective intelligence / collective action.

from The Rock (1934) by T. S. Eliot: Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?

Knowledge -individual/ego-centric Wisdom - transpersonal

Frank Zappa, in his song Packard Goose (1979, part of Joe's Garage): Information is not knowledge Knowledge is not wisdom Wisdom is not truth Truth is not beauty Beauty is not love Love is not music Music is THE BEST

I see wisdom as emerging from the individual and collective synthesis of many sources of  knowledge and information -  it is deeper understanding and meaning , meta analysis...

Ed: knowledge is a reflexive process. Wisdom is an emergent process.

Vincent: this is a visual representation of the definition of info, knowledge, and wisdom from Noel Postman :)

Knowledge allows us to do/ wisdom is contextually relevant and embodied

Arjun (my personal take): Information is everywhere, seen or unseen knowledge is basic visibility and comprehension of information in a limited context wisdom is the evolution of knowledge into greater and more meaningful/useful context given the experience and time of many
