_What is required to build Networks of Trust that foster sharing and nurture Wisdom Commons? What some considerations? Some constraints? Some protocols?_

People as agents and portals to wisdom- interoperability profiles

with respect to data, ownership and use rights is really important - if I maintain control over my own assets (this is engineered in), then I'm not so worried about trust

earlier in the day @Daniel Greenberg mentioned separation of self and ego - (my words now) that has gotten us here and have been trauma induced experiences for all life...the question i sit with how might we (species) become trauma competent (interchange and exchange) species?

Place based wisdom- meaning making- culture shift

Connection with nature

Right relations ( with eachother, with tech, with life, etc. et.c)

From the book Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World: the aboriginal author offers so many beautiful ways to understand and integrate traditional forms of knowledge and wisdom into our lives. One key is having multimodal ways of knowing that work together, so oral storytelling mixed with artistic physical creation, mixed with physical embodiment practices... This is how wisdom becomes integrated and useful. how do we integrate the digital with that? What is the right relationship with tech?

knowledge embedded in ecology

Btw - I got ‘Consent is the opposite of Colonialism’ from Fatima Mann, wanted to give her credit for her awesome work: https://www.fatimabarefootjd.com/

Storytelling- bringing stories into digital spaces and keeping them in place

What commitments can we make to commit to long term collaboration together

It can be as simple as short MoUs between each other’s platforms/projects to start :) would love to share the written agreements that maybe some of already have with each other and build on those

Opportunities for adopting Shared language, taxonomies, ontologies, commons semantics, shared badges, etc. (IRIS, SDG's and Beyond, etc.)
